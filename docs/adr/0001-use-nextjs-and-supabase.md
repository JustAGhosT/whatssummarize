**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-13  
**Deciders:** Project Leads  
**Consulted:** Development Team  
**Informed:** Stakeholders  

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a modern, scalable architecture for the WhatsApp Summarizer application that allows for rapid development, easy maintenance, and seamless integration with WhatsApp and AI summarization services.

### Problem
- Need to process and summarize WhatsApp conversations efficiently
- Require real-time updates and synchronization
- Need user authentication and data persistence
- Must handle media and text content

### Goals
- Fast development cycle
- Scalable architecture
- Real-time capabilities
- Secure data handling
- Easy deployment

### Non-Goals
- Building custom authentication
- Creating a custom database solution
- Developing a custom real-time engine

## Decision

We will use:
- **Next.js 14** for the frontend with App Router
- **Supabase** for backend services (Auth, Database, Storage)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development with Next.js and Supabase
- Built-in authentication and real-time capabilities
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Easy deployment options
- Large community and ecosystem

### Negative
- Vendor lock-in with Supabase
- Learning curve for team members new to these technologies
- Potential costs at scale

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- More control over backend
- Requires more setup and maintenance
- Would need to implement real-time features manually

### 2. Firebase
- Similar to Supabase but with less control over the database
- More expensive at scale
- More mature but with more complex pricing

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (Next.js)
- App Router for routing
- Server Components for better performance
- Client Components for interactivity
- API Routes for server-side functionality

### Backend (Supabase)
- PostgreSQL database
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Storage for media files
- Authentication with multiple providers
- Real-time subscriptions

## Next Steps

1. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure Supabase project
3. Implement authentication
4. Create database schema
5. Set up real-time subscriptions
