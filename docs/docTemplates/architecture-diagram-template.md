## Template Instructions

### For Architecture Diagrams:
1. **Use C4 Model consistently** - Start with Context, then Container, then Component level
2. **Follow visual standards** - Consistent colors, shapes, and notation
3. **Include legends** - Explain symbols, colors, and relationships
4. **Keep diagrams focused** - One concern per diagram, avoid overcrowding
5. **Version control diagrams** - Store source files in repository alongside code

### Cognitive Mesh Specific Guidelines:
- Map all components to appropriate mesh layers
- Show cross-layer interactions clearly
- Highlight AI/ML components in Reasoning layer
- Document feedback loops and self-optimization patterns
- Include mesh-native security and governance controls

### Maintenance:
- Update diagrams when architecture changes
- Validate diagrams during code reviews
- Archive outdated versions with clear deprecation notes
- Maintain both high-level and detailed views
- Ensure diagrams align with actual implementation
