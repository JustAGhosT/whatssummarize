## 1. Purpose & Scope

Describe the mesh capability under test, its criticality, mesh layers touched, and the overall purpose of this strategy.

## 2. Objectives

- Validate functional correctness across mesh layers
- Guarantee performance and scalability under expected and peak load
- Verify AI model quality, fairness, and drift resistance
- Ensure security, compliance, and data privacy adherence
- Establish automated pipelines for continuous testing in CI/CD

## 3. Quality Targets & KPIs

| Category | KPI | Target |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Unit Coverage | % statements | ≥ 80% |
| API Contract | # contract violations | 0 |
| P95 Latency | ms at 1× peak | < 200ms |
| Model Accuracy | F1 Score | ≥ 0.90 |
| Bias Threshold | Δ across segments | ≤ 3% |
| MTTR (prod) | Minutes | < 15 |

## 4. Mesh Testing Pyramid
```
        Exploratory / Chaos (5%)
      System & E2E (10%)
   Integration & Contract (20%)
        Unit & Component (65%)
```

## 5. Test Types & Scope

### 5.1 Unit & Component Tests
- Service methods, edge-case logic, failure paths.
- Mock mesh-layer dependencies where feasible.

### 5.2 Contract & Integration Tests
- OpenAPI schema validation with Dredd/Schemathesis.
- Cross-layer data contract checks (e.g., Foundation ↔ Reasoning JSON schemas).
- Security integration with Agency Layer (authn/authz).

### 5.3 System & End-To-End (E2E)
- Happy-path user journeys across Business ↔ Agency ↔ Reasoning layers.
- Non-functional: performance, volume, soak.
- AI evaluation harness for ground-truth comparisons.

### 5.4 Specialized Mesh Tests
- **AI Model Tests**: Baseline metrics, bias evaluation, drift simulation.
- **Self-Healing/Metacognitive Tests**: Verify learning loop actions, resilience to noisy feedback.
- **Security & Compliance**: Pen-tests, OWASP API checks, PII redaction validation.
- **Resilience/Chaos**: Inject failures into mesh services, validate graceful degradation.

## 6. Test Data Strategy

| Environment | Data Source | Anonymization | Volume |
|-------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Unit | Synthetic fixtures | N/A | Kilobytes |
| Integration | Masked prod subset | Yes | Megabytes |
| Perf | Scaled synthetic + masked prod | Yes | GB-scale |

- Use LakeFS branches for repeatable datasets.
- Tag AI evaluation datasets with version + ground truth snapshot.

## 7. Environments & Toolchain

| Stage | Infra | Tooling |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Local | Docker Compose / Tilt | Jest, PyTest, Postman, MockServer |
| CI | Kubernetes (KinD) | GitHub Actions, SonarQube, Spectral, k6 |
| Perf | Ephemeral k8s cluster (autoscaling) | k6 Cloud, Grafana Tempo |
| Security | Dedicated VPC | ZAP, Snyk, Checkov |

## 8. CI/CD Gates

1. **Pre-Commit**: Lint, unit tests (< 5 min)
2. **Pull Request**: Unit + Integration, contract checks, static code analysis.
3. **Merge to Main**: Full regression suite, security scan, container scan.
4. **Nightly**: E2E, load, AI re-evaluation.
5. **Release**: Soak test (4h), chaos suite, SLO validation.

## 9. Entry & Exit Criteria

| Phase | Entry | Exit |
|-------|-------|------|
| Unit | Code pushed | 100% tests pass, coverage ≥ target |
| Integration | All units pass | No contract failures, critical defects closed |
| System | Integration green | SLOs met, no sev-1 defects |
| Go-Live | All above pass | Risk sign-off, rollback plan in place |

## 10. Risk Areas & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Model drift | Medium | High | Daily drift monitor, auto-retrain pipeline |
| Cross-layer latency | Low | High | Caching + circuit breakers |
| Data privacy breach | Low | Critical | Automated PII scans, encryption, DLP |

## 11. Roles & RACI

| Activity | QA Lead | Dev | SRE | Data Sci | Security |
|----------|--------|-----|-----|----------|---------|
| Test plan | A | C | C | C | C |
| Unit tests | C | A | | | |
| Perf tests | C | C | A | | |
| AI eval | | | | A | C |
| Security pen-test | | | | | A |
