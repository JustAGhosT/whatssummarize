# Test Snapshots

This directory contains automatically generated test snapshots created by Jest.

## About Snapshots

Snapshots are used to test the output of components and other serializable values. They help detect unexpected changes in UI or output.

## Usage

- Snapshots are automatically generated when you run tests with `toMatchSnapshot()`
- To update snapshots after intentional changes, run:
  ```bash
  npm run test:update
  ```
- To update a single snapshot, press `u` in watch mode

## Guidelines

- Keep snapshots focused and minimal
- Avoid large snapshots that are hard to review
- Use descriptive test names
- Review snapshot changes carefully before committing
- Update snapshots when making intentional changes to component output

## Files

- `.snap` files are automatically generated by Jest
- Each test file with snapshots will have a corresponding `.snap` file
- Never manually edit these files
