# Test Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts used for testing purposes. These scripts are not tests themselves but support the testing process.

## Available Scripts

- `generate-test-data.js`: Generates mock data for testing
- `setup-test-environment.js`: Sets up the test environment before running tests

## Usage

Run scripts using Node.js:

```bash
node tests/scripts/generate-test-data.js
```

## Adding New Scripts

1. Create a new `.js` file in this directory
2. Add JSDoc comments to document the script's purpose and usage
3. Update this README to include the new script
